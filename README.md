Yt-dlp BcGUI is a graphical user interface for the command line tool yt-dlp.
The Bc part in the name comes from the word basic, so it is not a fancy GUI, instead it was designed to run fast (written in pure C language) with a simple interface. With this application you can do things like: download media (obviously), get a formatted list (generated in a .txt file) of the available media formats, update the yt-dlp downloader etc.
The application is written in C, it is small (only 124 KiB!) and does not depends on any other software framework (like .NET).
